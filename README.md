## :receipt: About
This is the second iteration of my personal portfolio website. The purpose of this website is to present an overview of my work, skills and capabilities and provide contact information all in one place.

### What have I improved since the previous version?
I really liked the overall design and colour scheme of the website. However, the structure of the website made scalability difficult as certain layouts should've been implemented in the skills and projects section to allow for future entries, with minimal touch-ups required afterwards. Overall, this version is much better built, with cleaner code and better responsiveness across all sections. More skills and projects have entered with many more to come in the future. Some things such as the linkedin and github links were also moved from the landing page to the contact page to create a cleaner, more minimal feel to the landing page. Lastly, the tags in the project cards have recieved a scrolling if they begin to overflow off the card, this also allows for more tags to be adding to projects without worry of the tags ruining the stucture of the card or overflowing.
